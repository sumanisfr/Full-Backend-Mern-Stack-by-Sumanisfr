//? npm :- Node package Manager
//* npm :- Node package manager is a tool that allows developers to install, share, and manage packages (libraries or modules) in their Node.js applications. It provides a vast ecosystem of open-source packages that can be easily integrated into projects, streamlining the development process.
//? npm init :- The command used to create a new Node.js project and generate a package.json file, which contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
//! npm install :- The command used to install packages from the npm registry. It can be used to install a specific package or all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
//* npm uninstall :- The command used to remove a package from the project. It updates the package.json file and removes the package from the node_modules directory.

// *--------------------------------------*
// dependencies
// ? dependencies -> These are the packages that your project needs to run in production. They are listed under the "dependencies" section in the package.json file.

// ! devDependencies -> These are the packages that are only needed during development, such as testing frameworks or build tools. They are listed under the "devDependencies" section in the package.json file.
//*  scripts -> Scripts are commands defined in the package.json file that can be run using npm. They allow you to automate tasks like starting a server, running tests, or building your project. The default script is "start", and you can define custom scripts as well.
