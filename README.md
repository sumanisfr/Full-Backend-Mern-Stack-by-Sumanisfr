**A complete social media backend application implementing core features**

#### Project Overview

LiteConnect is a simplified social media platform backend that demonstrates real-world application of all course concepts. Users can register, login, create posts, and interact through likes.

#### Core Features

- **User Management**
  - User registration with email validation
  - Secure login/logout with JWT authentication
  - Profile management and user information updates
  - Password reset functionality

- **Post System**
  - Create, read, update, and delete posts
  - Rich text content support
  - Image upload and attachment
  - Post categorization and tagging

- **Social Interactions**
  - Like/unlike posts
  - Comment system with nested replies
  - User following/followers functionality
  - Activity feed generation

- **Advanced Features**
  - Real-time notifications
  - Search functionality for users and posts
  - Content moderation tools
  - Analytics and user engagement metrics

#### Technical Implementation

- **Backend Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **File Storage**: Multer with cloud storage integration
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Jest
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with Swagger
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with production deployment
